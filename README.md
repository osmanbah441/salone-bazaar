## Problem

In Sierra Leone, talented entrepreneurs like Binta, a craftsperson in Makeni, struggle to reach customers beyond their immediate vicinity. Meanwhile, customers like Emmanuel waste precious time and resources travelling between shops to find the best deals. Our fragmented market limits growth for businesses and inconveniences consumers.

## Solution

SaloneBazaar is a user-friendly mobile marketplace that:
- Empowers local retailers to showcase their products to a nationwide audience.
- Provides customers with a one-stop shop to browse and buy from multiple sellers.
- Builds trust through user ratings and secure payment options.
- Facilitates efficient delivery through partnerships with local services.

## Brief Overview of Project Impact

- **Economic Growth**: By creating competition among local retailers, the platform can drive economic growth through better pricing, improved product quality, and increased business opportunities.
- **Price Transparency**: The app empowers consumers with transparent pricing, allowing them to compare prices easily, leading to fairer market practices and preventing price exploitation.
- **Job Creation**: The project will create new jobs in delivery services, customer support, and tech-related roles, helping to reduce unemployment and improve skill development in Sierra Leone.
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: The app provides easier access to a wide range of products, especially for those in remote areas, improving convenience and bridging gaps in product availability.
- **Digital Literacy**: By encouraging the use of digital platforms, the project promotes digital literacy, helping Sierra Leone integrate more effectively into the global digital economy.
- **Supply Chain Efficiency**: Incorporating delivery management features strengthens local supply chains, making distribution more efficient and reducing costs.

This impact makes the project not just a valuable tool for consumers but a potential driver of broader socio-economic development in Sierra Leone.
